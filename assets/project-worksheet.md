# Project Overview

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality

## Wireframes

Include images of your wireframes. 

## Game Components

### Landing Page
What will a player see when they start your game?

### Game Initialization

### Winning The Game
What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?

### Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |
