## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

The biggest challenge would be animating the window with different symbols.


## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

Game will have 
Start Button- symbols will spin on click
Stop Button- stops the spinning and display randomize combination
Reset button- set to default
Display message- win or lose logic (match 3 symbols or 2 or none)

If itâ€™s multiple play game- will add up the score of each play and display final score.
